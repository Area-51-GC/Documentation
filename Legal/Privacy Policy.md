<h2 id="how-we-use-your-data"><a href="#how-we-use-your-data">2. How We Use Your Data</a></h2>

We use information about you to:

- Provide, maintain and improve the Services;
- Research and develop new services;
- Help protect the safety of our Community and its user, which includes blocking suspected spammers, addressing abuse, and enforcing the Terms of Service and our other policies;
- Send you technical notices, updates, security alerts, invoices, and other support and administrative messages;
- Provide support;
- Communicate with you about products, services, promotions, and events.

Much of the information on the Services is public and accessible to everyone, even without an account. By using the Services, you are directing us to share this information publicly and freely.

**We do not sell data to third parties.**

We share data with third parties only in the following compelling circumstances:

- Comply with our legal obligations;
- Enforcement of our policies and rights.

<h2 id="your-choices"><a href="#your-choices">3. Your Choices</a></h2>

You have choices about how to protect and limit the collection, use, and sharing of information about you when you use the Services. Some of these choices are available to everybody who uses our Services, while others only apply if you have an account.

|                                           |                                                              |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| *Accessing and Changing Your Information* | You can access and change certain information through the Services. You can also request a copy of the personal information we maintain about you. |
| *Deleting Your Account*                   | You may delete your account information at any time from the user preferences page. You can also submit a request to delete the personal information we maintain about you. |
| *Controlling the Use of Cookies*          | Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove or reject first- and third-party cookies. Please note that if you choose to remove or reject cookies, this could affect the availability and functionality of our Services. For more information on controlling how cookies and similar technologies are used on our Services, see our Cookie Notice. |
| *Do Not Track*                            | Most modern web browsers give you the option to send a Do Not Track signal to the sites you visit, indicating that you do not wish to be tracked. However, there is no accepted standard for how a site should respond to this signal, and we do not take any action in response to this signal. Instead, in addition to publicly available third-party tools, we offer you the choices described in this policy to manage the collection and use of information about you. |

<h2 id="your-rights"><a href="#your-rights">4. Your Rights</a></h2>

### Data Subject and Consumer Information Requests

Requests for a copy of the information Reddit has about your account—including EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) data subject access requests—can be submitted through Your Account page.

### Additional Information for EEA Users

Users in the European Economic Area have the right to request access to, rectification of, or erasure of their personal data; to data portability in certain circumstances; to request restriction of processing; to object to processing; and to withdraw consent for processing where they have previously provided consent. These rights can be exercised using the information provided under “Your Choices” above or as described in the “Your Rights - Data Subject and Consumer Information Requests section” above. EEA users also have the right to lodge a complaint with their local supervisory authority.

As required by applicable law, we collect and process information about individuals in the EEA only where we have a legal basis for doing so. Our legal bases depend on the Services you use and how you use them. We process your information on the following legal bases:

- You have consented for us to do so for a specific purpose;
- We need to process the information to provide you the Services, including to operate the Services, provide customer support and personalised features and to protect the safety and security of the Services;
- It satisfies a legitimate interest (which is not overridden by your data protection interests), such as preventing fraud, ensuring network and information security, enforcing our rules and policies, protecting our legal rights and interests, research and development, personalising the Services, and marketing and promoting the Services; or
- We need to process your information to comply with our legal obligations.

### Children

Children under the age of 12 are not allowed to create an account or otherwise use the Services. Additionally, if you are in the EEA, you must be over the age required by the laws of your country to create an account or otherwise use the Services, or we need to have obtained verifiable consent from your parent or legal guardian.

<h3 id="changes-to-this-policy"><a href="#changes-to-this-policy">Changes to This Policy</a></h3>

We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we do, we will let you know by revising the date at the top of the policy. If the changes, in our sole discretion, are material, we may also notify you by sending an email to the address associated with your account (if you have chosen to provide an email address) or by otherwise providing notice through our Services. We encourage you to review the Privacy Policy whenever you access or use our Services or otherwise interact with us to stay informed about our information practices and the ways you can help protect your privacy.
