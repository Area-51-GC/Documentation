Hello, comrades and people of the Internet! These Terms of Service ("**Terms**" or "**ToS**") applies to your access to and use of the websites, widgets, APIs, game servers, Discord server and other online products and services (collectively, the "**Services**") provided by Area 51 Gaming Community ("**Area 51**", "**we**", "**us**" or "**our**").

Remember Area 51 is for fun and is intended to be a place for your entertainment, but we still need some basic rules. By accessing or using our Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not access or use our Services.

Please take a look at our [Privacy Policy](/legal/Privacy-Policy) too—it explains how and why we collect, use and share information about you when you access or use our Services.

## [1. Access to the Services](/legal/Terms-of-Service#Access-to-the-Services)

Children under the age of 14 are not allowed to create an Account or otherwise use the Services. Additionally, you must be over the age required by the laws of your country or have verifiable consent from your parent or legal guardian to create an Account or otherwise use the Services.

In addition, certain Services or portions of our Services require you to be 18 years of age or older, so please read all notices and any additional Terms carefully when accessing the Services.

If you are accepting these Terms on behalf of another legal entity, including a business or government entity or agency, you represent that you have full legal authority to bind such entity to these Terms.

## [2. Usage of the Services](/legal/Terms-of-Service#Usage-of-the-Services)

Area 51 grants you a personal, non-transferable, non-exclusive, revocable, limited licence to use and access the Services solely as permitted by these Terms. We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you by these Terms.

Except as permitted through the Services or as otherwise permitted by us in writing, your licence does not include the right to:

- licence, sell, transfer, assign, distribute, host, or otherwise commercially exploit the Services or Content;
- modify, prepare derivative works of, disassemble, decompile, or reverse engineer any part of the Services or Content; or
- access the Services or Content in order to build a similar or competitive website, product, or service.

We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue the Services (in whole or in part) at any time, without notice to you. Any future release, update, or other addition to functionality of the Services will be subject to these Terms, which may be updated from time to time. You agree that we will not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension, or discontinuation of the Services or any part thereof.

## [3. Your Account and Account Security](/legal/Terms-of-Service#Your-Account-and-Account-Security)

To use certain features of our Services, you may be required to create an Area 51 account (an "**Account**") and provide us with a username, password, and certain other information about yourself as set forth in the [Privacy Policy](/legal/Privacy-Policy).

You are solely responsible for the information associated with your Account and anything that happens related to your Account. You must maintain the security of your Account and immediately notify Area 51 if you discover or suspect that someone has accessed your Account without your permission. We recommend that you use a strong password that is used only with your Account and enable multi-factor authentication.

You will not licence, sell, or transfer your Account without our prior written approval.

## [4. Your Content](/legal/Terms-of-Service#Your-Content)

The Services may contain information, text, links, graphics, photos, videos, or other materials ("**Content**"), including Content created or submitted to the Services by you or through your Account ("**Your Content**"). We take no responsibility for and we do not expressly or implicitly endorse, support, or guarantee the completeness, truthfulness, accuracy, or reliability of any of Your Content.

By submitting Your Content to the Services, you represent and warrant that you have all rights, power, and authority necessary to grant the rights to Your Content contained within these Terms. Because you alone are responsible for Your Content, you may expose yourself to liability if you post or share Content without all necessary rights.

You retain any ownership rights you have in Your Content, but you grant Area 51 the following licence to use that Content:

When Your Content is created with or submitted to the Services, you grant us a worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, transferable, and sublicensable licence to use, copy, modify, adapt, prepare derivative works of, distribute, store, perform, and display Your Content and any name, username, voice, or likeness provided in connection with Your Content in all media formats and channels now known or later developed anywhere in the world. This licence includes the right for us to make Your Content available for syndication, broadcast, distribution, or publication by other companies, organisations, or individuals who partner with Area 51. You also agree that we may remove metadata associated with Your Content, and you irrevocably waive any claims and assertions of moral rights or attribution with respect to Your Content.

Any ideas, suggestions, and feedback about Area 51 or our Services that you provide to us are entirely voluntary, and you agree that Area 51 may use such ideas, suggestions, and feedback without compensation or obligation to you.

Although we have no obligation to screen, edit, or monitor Your Content, we may, in our sole discretion, delete or remove Your Content at any time and for any reason, including violating these Terms, violating our [Code of Conduct](/legal/Code-of-Conduct), or if you otherwise create or are likely to create liability for us.

## [5. Third-Party Content, Advertisements, and Promotions](/legal/Terms-of-Service#Third-Party-Content-Advertisements-and-Promotions)

The Services may contain links to third-party websites, products, or services, which may be posted by authorised advertisers, our affiliates, our partners, or other users ("**Third-Party Content**"). Third-Party Content is not under our direct control, and we are not responsible for any third party's websites, products, or services. Your use of Third-Party Content is at your own risk and you should make any investigation you feel necessary before proceeding with any transaction in connection with such Third-Party Content.

The Services may also contain sponsored Third-Party Content or advertisements. The type, degree, and targeting of advertisements are subject to change, and you acknowledge and agree that we may place advertisements in connection with the display of any Content or information on the Services, including Your Content.

To conduct a contest or sweepstake ("**Promotion**"), you need to be authorised by Area 51. If you choose to conduct such Promotions, you alone are responsible for conducting the Promotion in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations at your own risk. Your Promotion must state that the Promotion is not sponsored by, endorsed by, or associated with Area 51, and the rules for your Promotion must require each entrant or participant to release Area 51 from any liability related to the Promotion.

## [6. Things You Cannot Do](/legal/Terms-of-Service#Things-You-Cannot-Do)
